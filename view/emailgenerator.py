### Introduction to the Automated Job Application Email Generator
Welcome to the **Automated Job Application Email Generator!** This application is designed to streamline the job application process by generating a personalized email to the hiring manager based on your resume or CV and the job posting you want to apply to. It saves time and ensures your email is both professional and tailored to the specific job opportunity, giving you an edge in the job market.

Purpose of the App
The app was created to help job seekers simplify the process of applying for jobs. Typically,\n writing personalized emails for each job application can be time-consuming and repetitive. This app removes that burden by allowing users to upload their resume or CV along with the job posting they are interested in, and in return, it generates a custom email that highlights their qualifications and interest in the job.

By leveraging advanced AI models and natural language processing (NLP), this app ensures that your email is polished, professional, and aligned with the job description. Whether you are applying to multiple roles or a single position, this tool helps you stand out with ease and confidence.

How It Works
Upload Your Resume or CV:

The app allows users to upload their resume or CV in document format (e.g., PDF or Word). The app uses this document to extract key details such as your skills, qualifications, and professional experience.
Provide a Job Posting Link:

Users can input a link to the job posting they want to apply to. The app will analyze the job description, extract critical information like job requirements, responsibilities, and preferred skills, and use this information to customize the email.
Email Generation:

Using the data extracted from your resume and the job posting, the app generates a well-written and professional email addressed to the hiring manager. The email emphasizes your qualifications and makes a compelling case for why you are a good fit for the role.
Review and Edit:

The app allows you to review the generated email and make any final tweaks before sending it or copying it to use in your email client.
